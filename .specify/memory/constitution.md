## Sync Impact Report
**Version change**: 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 (editorial — shortened and restructured, no principle changes)
**Templates reviewed**: plan-template.md ✅ spec-template.md ✅ tasks-template.md ✅

## Sync Impact Report
**Version change**: 1.0.1 → 1.1.0 (minor — added exception clauses to §VI and §VIII for localhost single-user developer tools)
**Rationale**: The Argus project is a localhost-bound, single-developer tool. §VI's blanket auth requirement and §VIII's 10k-user target are designed for networked multi-user services and must not block legitimate local tooling.

# Argus Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Engineering
- Systems MUST be reliable, observable, and debuggable.
- Prefer simple solutions; every abstraction requires justification.
- All functionality MUST be testable in isolation.
- All changes MUST be reversible (feature flags, migrations, rollback).
- Design for scale from the beginning.

### II. Architecture
- All services MUST have clear, versioned API boundaries.
- No service MAY directly access another service's database.
- All inter-service communication MUST happen via APIs.
- All long-running work MUST be asynchronous with observable status.

### III. Code Standards
- Code MUST be readable and self-documenting (comments explain *why*, not *what*).
- Functions MUST be < 50 lines.
- All public APIs MUST have documentation.
- Use structured logging (JSON/key-value) — no unstructured logs in production.

### IV. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Tests MUST be written before implementation. No exceptions.
- Follow Red-Green-Refactor strictly.
- No PR may be submitted without tests written first.

### V. Testing Requirements
- All features MUST have unit tests.
- All APIs MUST have integration tests.
- All critical flows MUST have end-to-end tests.
- All AI-generated code MUST be reviewed by a human before merge.
- Test coverage MUST NOT decrease with any PR.

### VI. Security & Compliance
- All endpoints MUST enforce authentication and authorization.
  - **Exception**: Services bound exclusively to `127.0.0.1` that serve a single local user MAY use network isolation in lieu of auth/authz. This exception MUST be explicitly declared in the feature specification and is only valid for v1 of local developer tools. Post-v1 network exposure requires full auth.
- No secrets in source code, config files, or logs.
- All actions MUST be audit-logged (actor, timestamp, outcome).
- Follow least-privilege access for all services and users.

### VII. Observability
- All services MUST emit structured logs, metrics, and a health check endpoint.
- All failures MUST be traceable via correlation IDs or distributed tracing.

### VIII. Performance
- APIs MUST respond within 500ms at p95.
- System MUST support 10,000 concurrent users.
  - **Exception**: Single-user localhost developer tools are exempt from the 10,000 user target. Such tools MUST instead define their actual concurrency target explicitly in the feature specification (e.g., "≥10 concurrent sessions").
- System MUST degrade gracefully under overload.

### IX. AI Usage
- AI MAY generate implementation code but MUST NOT make architecture decisions.
- AI MUST NOT handle security-critical code without explicit human review.
- All AI-generated outputs MUST be validated with tests before merge.

### X. Definition of Done
A feature is complete only when ALL are satisfied:
- [ ] Code written and reviewed
- [ ] Tests written test-first and passing
- [ ] Documentation written
- [ ] Metrics and logs added
- [ ] Security reviewed

## Governance

Amendments require a dedicated PR (not a feature branch), a migration plan, and a version bump. Run `/speckit.constitution` to propagate changes to templates. Constitution violations found by `/speckit.analyze` are **CRITICAL** and block merge.

**Versioning**: MAJOR = principle removed/redefined · MINOR = new principle · PATCH = clarification
